For many, this is a tough time, and so by creating this website, my aim is to: - Get the youth in our community to share their projects that they are working on, anything they would like to collaborate on - Support those that may need any help - Most importantly, to preserve our culture through gallery of our village, traditions, and tibetan musical instruments.",
