# Upper Mustang Community Website!

As the coronavirus pandemic has set in, it's important for us as a community to be together while maintaining social distance.
For many, this is a tough time, and so by creating this website, my aim is to:
- Get the youth in our community to share their projects that they are working on, anything they would like to collaborate on
- Support those that may need any help
- Most importantly, to preserve our culture through gallery of our village, traditions, and tibetan musical instruments.
