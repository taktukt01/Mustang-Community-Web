# Upper Mustang Community Website!
  By creating this website, my aim is to:
- Get the youth in our community to share their projects that they are working on, anything they would like to collaborate on
- Support those that may need any help
- Most importantly, to preserve our culture through gallery of our village, traditions, and tibetan musical instruments.


**This is not a final product, I am working to add more features in the coming future.**

*Don't hesitate to contact me at taktukgg@gmail.com if you want to collaborate on this project with me!*
